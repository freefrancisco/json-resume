## My Resume
This resume was generated using JSON Resume. The `resume` executable was installed with `npm install -g resume-cli` and I ran `resume init` to have it create a prefilled resume that conforms to the schema. To actually have it be visible I needed to install the flat theme like this `npm install jsonresume-theme-flat` and that's how I can add more themes.

To view it locally run `resume serve --theme flat`.

For more info go to the JSON resume website https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/ that's where all the available themes are listed too.
